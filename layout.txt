GameBoard:

    2D Array
    Dynamically Sized and Allocated in C with malloc
    Has perimeter of ? and ? characters on vertical and horizontal sides respectively that kill the snake

Food:

    Spawns in a random position on the game board
    Does not spawn in walls
    Does not spawn in snake
    
    Choosing a spawn position:
        Two arrays each with a size of width*height
        Each element in both arrays correspond to a specific position on the gameboard
        One array called key
        One array called hand

        * location - refers to index in array
        * position - refers to slot on the game board

        Hand: 
        Used find a valid position to place food (aka. not on top of the snake)
        Key: used to bind each position to its location in the hand

        Hand Methodology:
        The last snakeSize elements of the hand are all the positions the snake is at
        Therefor to place a food at a valid position choose a location from 0 to Width*Height - snakesize

        Example:
        All characters represent different board positions:

        Snake Size=3
                          |-----|
Hand[]: a, c, d, e, g, f, h, i, b

        Because snake size is 3 the last 3 characters (h, i, b) represent the 3 positions the snake is it

        If we had to place a new food use one of the 0 to 5 positions

        Key:
        The key array marks the index each position is at in the hand
        For this example our key would be

        a , b , c , d , e , f , g , h , i
Key[]:  0 , 8 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 4 , 6 , 7


    The swapKeyValues function (hopefully) handles swapping the indicies of the positions in the key and hand array
        When the new head is placed on a food its location is swapped with Width*Height-snakesize-1
        When the new head is not placed on a food its location is swapped with the location of the old tail

Snake: 
    Build with a simple queue.
    Every game frame the snake moves
        If the snake moves into a position that there is no food dequeue the tail of the snake and enqueue its new head
        If the snake moves into a position that there is a food do not dequeue the tail of the snake and still enqueue its new head
